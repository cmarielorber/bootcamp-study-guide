## Description

This is a very basic Prework Study Guide Webpage which introduces a student to common codes, protocols, and steps in creating a super basic webpage. 

My motivation was purely exposure purposes for what the course will be teaching me, as well as, foundation for my future new career. 

This provides a space to view bullet points of notes, but I honestly had so much written down and still spiraling in my head that never made it to the end project. Saving it for class...

I learned that coding is a tedious, methodical and exciting process. It requires patience, thought, and repetition to perfect. 

Practice, communication, open dialog, and mental breaks and grace will get me through this new language of coding. Let the fun begin!
